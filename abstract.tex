\abstract{
  For the metric arc \(I=[0,1]\) and continuum-valued bonding relation
  \(f\subseteq_{\operatorname{cl}} I^2\),
  the inverse limit \(\varprojlim\{I,f,\omega\}\)
  is the subspace of the countable
  power \(I^\omega\) containing sequences \(\vec x\) satisfying
  \(\vec x(n)\in f(\vec x(n+1))\). A recent trend in continuum theory is
  to generalize this notion to \(\varprojlim\{I,f,L\}\), where \(L\) is
  an arbitrary linear order. When \(L=\omega\), the inverse limit is a
  subspace of the metrizable space \(I^\omega\); however, we will show that
  when \(L\) is uncountable, the inverse limit cannot be metrizable unless
  \(f\) is trivial. Furthermore, when \(L\) is an uncountable well
  order, it will be shown that the inverse limit is not even Corson compact.
